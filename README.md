# Meta_analysis_cogn_dnFEP
This meta-analysis examined the mean difference in cognition between anti-psychotic drug-naive first-episode psychosis patients and controls. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of within-group variability was also conducted. The sample consisted of 50 studies, with 2625 FEP patients and 2917 controls.  

The meta analysis plan was pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022367467). 

This repository contains the R-files used to conduct the meta-analyses, as well as code for re-producing the plots in the article (the forest plots were later combined in Illustrator, not R).
